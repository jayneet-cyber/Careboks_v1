# Careboks_v1
Careboks helps clinicians communicate complex medical information in a clear, structured, patient-appropriate format. The system adapts content to patient attributes (age, sex, health literacy, comorbidities, language, etc.) and ensures clinical safety via mandatory clinician approval before communication.
